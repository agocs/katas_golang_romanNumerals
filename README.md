Roman Numeral kata implemented in Go
==========================

Decimal to Roman Numeral is supported. Roman.go contains the logic for that. The function `toRoman(int x) string` takes any decimal and turns it into a roman numeral string. As is typical for this sort of thing, `toRoman()` only supports positive integers, and will produce suboptimal results for inputs > 3999.

Roman to Decimal works too. I've had it working for months now, but I messed up a test. EL OH EL.
